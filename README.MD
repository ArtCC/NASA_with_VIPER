## Architecting iOS and macOS Apps with my VIPER (application of Clean Architecture) with NASA Open APIs

#### For this project I use NASA Open APIs: [NASA Open APIs site](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html)

### Dependencies

I use Carthage for dependency management. If you don't have Carthage installed refer to [Installing Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage).

Run carthage update --platform iOS before opening the project in XCode.

#### In progress...
