## Architecting iOS and macOS Apps with VIPER (application of Clean Architecture) with NASA Open APIs

#### This project is in progress...

#### For this project I use NASA Open APIs: [NASA Open APIs site](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html). You can create one :)

This project is an example of VIPER architecture on iOS app with Swift.

### Dependencies

- I use Carthage for dependency management. If you don't have Carthage installed refer to [Installing Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage).

	Run <b>carthage update --platform iOS</b> before opening the project in XCode.
	
- I use Swiftlint for guide style:

	<b>brew install swiftlint</b>
